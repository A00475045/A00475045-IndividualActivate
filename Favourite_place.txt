Hi there, I am Ranjit and my favourite place is my village, which is located on the bank of Gandak River in the Kushinagar district of UP, INDIA. Life is slow paced there and no one is in a hurry. The only thing thats stoping me from moving there full time is there is a huge problem with electricity there.
